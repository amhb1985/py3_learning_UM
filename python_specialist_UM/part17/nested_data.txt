this is about information for the Nested data 


in the nested data we have some diffrent type of the nested:

- list in list >>>    [] > []    for example   data = [  [1, 2, 3 ] ,  ["A","b","c" ]  ]
-  Dictionary in List  {} > []        for example   DATA_B = [ { "a" :1 , "b" : 2 }, { "DD" :4 , "EE" : 5 },  ]

There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called square. 
It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. 
Write code to assign a variable called xyz the value 5*5 (five squared). 
Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with *
'''
# Assuming you have a function named square
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Assign the variable xyz the value of 5 squared using the square function
xyz = square(6)

# Print the result
print(xyz)

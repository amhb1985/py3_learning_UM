we can set in this form some table form in readme file: 
Introduction: Working with Data Files:

| Method Name:  | Use:                      |  Explanation:
| ------------- | -------------             | ------------- |
| open          | open(filename,'r')        | Open a file called filename and use it for reading. This will return a reference to a file object.| 
| open          | open(filename,'w')        | Open a file called filename and use it for writing. This will also return a reference to a file object.  | 
| close         | filevariable.close()       | File use is complete.  |


in another hand we can open the file with this format:
#we need the path of file in our system :
# in VS code  we can fild the path with the right click of it.

open("CompanyData/YearlyProjections.csv", "r")



for the next step we can use now another commend:

Recipe for Reading and Processing a File:
#1. Open the file using with and open.

#2. Use .readlines() to get a list of the lines of text in the file.

#3. Use a for loop to iterate through the strings in the list, each being one line from the file. On each iteration, process that line of text

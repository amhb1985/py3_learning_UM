this is about exception Handling fow of control:

What is an exception?
An exception is a signal that a condition has occurred that can’t be easily handled using the normal 
flow-of-control of a Python program. Exceptions are often defined as being “errors” 
but this is not always the case. All errors in Python are dealt with using exceptions, but not all exceptions are errors.

this part ois about Inheritance in Py3
 but whats the Inheritance?

 Classes can “inherit” methods and class variables from other classes. 
 We’ll see the mechanics of how this works in subsequent sections. First, however, 
 let’s motivate why this might be valuable. It turns out that inheritance doesn’t let you do anything that you couldn’t do without it, but it makes some things a lot more elegant. You will also find it’s useful when someone else has defined a class in a module or library,
  and you just want to override a few things without having to reimplement everything they’ve done.

There are two ways to use the pop method. The first, with no parameter, 
will remove and return the last item of the list. If you provide a parameter for the position, 
pop will remove and return the item at that position. Either way the list is changed.

The following table provides a summary of the list methods shown above. 
The column labeled result gives an explanation as to what the return value is as it relates
 to the new value of the list. The word mutator means that the list is changed by the method 
 but nothing is returned (actually None is returned). A hybrid method is one that 
 not only changes the list but also returns a value as its result. Finally,
  if the result is simply a return, then the list is unchanged by the method.

Be sure to experiment with these methods to gain a better understanding of what they do.

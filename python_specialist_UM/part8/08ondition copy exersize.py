Implement the calculator for the date of Easter.

The following algorithm computes the date for Easter Sunday for any year between 1900 to 2099.

Ask the user to enter a year. Compute the following:
'''
#a = year % 19
#b = year % 4
#c = year % 7
#d = (19 * a + 24) % 30
#e = (2 * b + 4 * c + 6 * d + 5) % 7
#dateofeaster = 22 + d + e
#Special note: The algorithm can give a date in April. You will know that the date is in April if the calculation gives you an answer greater than 31. (Youâ€™ll need to adjust) Also, if the year is one of four special years (1954, 1981, 2049, or 2076) then subtract 7 from the date.

#Your program should print an error message if the user provides a date that is out of range.


def calculate_easter(year):
    if year < 1900 or year > 2099:
        print("Error: Year must be between 1900 and 2099.")
        return None
    
    a = year % 19
    b = year % 4
    c = year % 7
    d = (19 * a + 24) % 30
    e = (2 * b + 4 * c + 6 * d + 5) % 7
    date_of_easter = 22 + d + e
    
    # Check if the date is in April
    if date_of_easter > 31:
        date_of_easter -= 31
        month = "April"
    else:
        month = "March"
    
    # Check if it's a special year
    if year in [1954, 1981, 2049, 2076]:
        date_of_easter -= 7
    
    return f"Easter Sunday for the year {year} is on {month} {date_of_easter}."


# Input year from the user

rainfall_mi is a string that contains the average number of inches of rainfall in Michigan for every month (in inches) with every month separated by a comma. Write code to compute the number of months that have more than 3 inches of rainfall. Store the result in the variable num_rainy_months. In other words, count the number of items with values > 3.0.

Hard-coded answers will receive no credit.

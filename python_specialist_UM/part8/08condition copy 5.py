#so in this chapter we r going to Conditional Execution: Binary Selection:

'''x = 0

if x % 2 == 0:
    print(x, "is even")
else:
    print(x, "is odd")
'''
#the Test:
#Create a variable, b, and assign it the value of 15. Then, write code to see if the value b is greater than that of a. If it is, aâ€™s value should be multiplied by 2. If the value of b is less than or equal to a,
# nothing should happen. Finally, create variable c and assign it the value of the sum of a and b.

# Given variables
a = 10
b = 25

# Check if b is greater than a
if b > a:
    # Multiply a by 2 if b is greater than a
    a *= 2

# Calculate the sum of a and b
c = a + b

print("Value of a:", a)
print("Value of b:", b)
print("Value of c:", c)
#test agian with this:
print("Value of d:", d)

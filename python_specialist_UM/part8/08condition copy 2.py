# this is the Test again about the type and defition of Boolans Data:

#its easy to know more about boolan, like below:
'''
print(True)
print(type(True))
print(type(False))
'''
#Look at this example to define :
#print(type(True))
#print(type("True"))

#another  example to do it again with Int and Float:
print(type(13))
print(type(13.2))
# after that we can see the type of every element with type()

#this abbot the data type in python

# we speek and train again about the python scripts and data type in python
# so we can do again for this week 

# this one actuallly is chapter 6 and about String data type
# we are speaking now about diffrent Issue:
'''
1. String Data Type

2. Reading and Converting
its like some Input
as string or Integer

3. Looking Inside Strings
like a charachter or each word inside of a varible for example 'banana'
'''
'''
fruit = 'banana'
letter = fruit[1]
print(letter)
'''
'''
x = 3
w = fruit[x - 1]
print(w)

4. A character Too Far
zot = 'abc'
print(zot[5])

#5. String Have Length >>len()
fruit = 'banana'
print(len(fruit))
actually len is a Functionc..
'''
'''
#6. Loopinng Throgh Strings:

'''
'''
fruit = 'banana'
index = 0 
while index < len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print(index, letter)
    index = index + 1
'''
'''
#we can use the easily use another form to raech same 
'''''''
'''

#6'''. Loop and Counting
'''
'''
'''
#7. Looking deeper in to in:
for letter in 'banana' :
    print(letter)

#8. Slicing String
s = 'Monty Python'
print(s[1:4])
'''
'''

#The next lection is about 
#Manupulation

# 2.1. String Concatention
'''
'''a = 'Hello'
b = a + ' There'
print(b)

#2.2. Using in as  a Loogical Operator:
fruit = 'banana'
if 'a' in fruit :
    print('Found it !')
'''
